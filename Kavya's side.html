        <p class="pclass"> From strangers to closest friends???? It’s possible, it’s annoying sometimes, its interesting, but to the most part, when its real, its the best feeling ever. Though we’ve not known each other for that long, you are still my closest friend Khansa. We really just clicked from the day we met. I realised that we are very similar, not just in the way we think, but also the things we’ve gone through. We’ve had very similar past experience and it’s comforting knowing I have someone who truly understands me, someone who I don’t need to explain what I am going through but still understands. You’ve always been there for me, so thank you for always being there for me, for once I feel comfortable talking about my problems with someone. For once I don’t have to worry about not being able to trust someone, so for that I thank you, and I can only hope to repay the favor one day. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass"> Our friendship is indeed timeless, we’ve known each other for less than half a year, and yet you are my closest friend. For once I don’t feel like I have to force the friendship, I don’t have to prove my worth, for once I feel valued without forcing it. This is the only kind of friendship I have wanted, and that’s one where there is mutual trust and respect without having to ask for it. I truly appreciate our friendship and am grateful for having met such an amazing person like you. I <a href="secret.html">promise</a> to always be there for you. Speaking of <a href="secret.html">promises</a> how many have I already made to you? Well it doesn’t matter, I only make <a href="secret.html">promises</a> I can keep, and I am a man of my word. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass">Well yes our friendship is amazing and all, but it really wouldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for you. If it wasn’t for your character, if it wasn’t for the way you are, we probably wouldn’t have become friends. You are such an amazing person, even after everything you’ve gone through, you remained kind hearted, you remained humble, you remained a reliable person. If it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t be the way I am right now. So I know at times you may not feel it, or you may not realise it, or you may become doubtful over it, but you are worth every single bit of it. You are an amazing person, don’t let anyone else say otherwise, not even me, not even yourself. You are an amazing person to be around, and I hope you don’t change the way you are, because I understand you go through a lot, but anytime something happens, I will always be here for you, so please don’t let anyone change your character, you are an amazing person and you are worth every single bit of effort. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass">I’ve spoken about everything I could think of, but I feel like there is a lot more missing, unfortunately there aren’t enough words in the dictionary for express my gratitude to how you are, or enough words to express how nice of a person you are, or enough words to express how our friendship is in the first place, so for now I guess I will have to stick with the usual, thank you, thank you for always being there for me when I needed you, thank you for walking into my life and staying, and thank you for being an amazing person. I will always be here for you whenever you need me, and I will never let you suffer or struggle with anything alone.
